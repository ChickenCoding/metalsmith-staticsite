Setting up  nodejs app deploys with git & pm2

Things I've learned:

1. NEVER use relative paths in shell scripts. Use $HOME if you won't know the
   user / home path

2. PM2 is a great tool, but when using it with NVM we should take extra care that
   the same user & pm2 instance is the one that starts, stops and controls the app

3. PM2 process hanged, was not showing the app int pm2 status, killing the node process
   just respawned a new one so the only way I could get rid of hanging pm2 process was to
   reboot the machine

4. Use .json config files when starting the app with pm2 from an automate script.
   This mitigates the issue with the pm2 exec cwd (current working directory).
   When calling pm2 from a script, if we don't specify the cwd in a config file, pm2
   will set it at it's caller's location (ie. ~/www/repos/boilerplate/hooks) and this
   was breaking relative paths in our application
